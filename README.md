MongooseAdmin
=============

Minimalist admin page for Node.js projects using Mongoose and Express.js.


Why
---
Main usage will be for small projects where you need an admin page for CRUD operations.
Just add it as a middleware and use it.
When your project grows and you have spent days to develop you own admin page, you can remove MongooseAdmin.

What to expect
--------------
1. Create CRUD operations on the models defined in Mongoose
2. Hook it in as a Express.js middleware.
3. Options to change authentication etc.


How to use
----------
Basic usage
```
var mongooseadmin = require('mongooseadmin');
app.use(mongooseadmin('/admin'));
```

You can extend with your own authentication:

```
var options = {
    authentication:
        function (username, password, callback) {
            callback(username == 'johndoe' && password == 'supersecret');
        }
    };
app.use(mongooseadmin('/admin', options));
```

Options
-------
*authentication* A function that takes the parameters username, password and callback.
The callback expects to receive a boolean value for if the username and password is valid.

Next steps
----------
- Options for title, layout, etc
- Add search filters
- Better support for references by ObjectId
- Support for sub documents
